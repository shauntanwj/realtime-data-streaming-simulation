    "Structured Streaming API which processes data in batches of 10 seconds. The\n",
    "streaming application will receive streaming data from all three producers and\n",
    "processes it as follows:\n",
    "- Group the streams based on the location (i,e, latitude and longitude) and create the data model developed in Part A.\n",
    "- You can find if two locations are close to each other or not by implementing the geo-hashing algorithm or find a library that does the job for you. The precision number in the algorithm determines the number of characters in the Geohash. Please use precision 3. If the climate data and hotspot data are not close to each other we can ignore the hotspot data and just store the climate data.\n",
    "- If the streaming application has the data from only one producer (Producer 1), it implies that there was no fire at that time and we can store the climate data into MongoDB straight away.\n",
    "- If we receive the data from two different satellites AQUA and TERRA for the same location (to determine whether the two locations are the same or not please use geohash with precision 5), then average the ‘surface temperature’ and ‘confidence’ from the two satellites and save it as a fire event.\n",
    "- If a fire was detected with an air temperature greater than 20 (°C) and a GHI greater than 180 (W/m 2 ), then report the cause of the fire event as ‘natural’. Otherwise, report the cause of the fire event as ‘other’.\n",
